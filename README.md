# Instructions
1. Ensure the phone is in portrait mode and auto-rotate is disabled
2. Use Google Chrome on Android to make sure the light sensor works
    1. Go to chrome://flags
    2. Search ‘Generic Sensor Extra Classes’
    3. Set it to Enabled
3. Load the website
4. Swipe up on the lockscreen to access the screen for entering the passcode
    1. The assets may take a bit to load
5. There are 4 buttons:
    1. Hold: allows you to hold the bomb and spin it with the phones gyroscope
    2. Manual: allows you to select radio buttons to choose a face
    3. Reset: allows you to reset each face to redo the unlock
    4. Defuse: allows you to enter the combination and attempt to unlock the phone (thus attempting to defuse the bomb)
6. Each face has a number button on it. Clicking on it will show the ‘unlock’ you have to do. Each face must be completed before clicking ‘Defuse’ to unlock the phone.
    1. Each face has a LED light indicating if it has been attempted yet. Red is incomplete and Blue is attempted.
7. Front Face: Shows a keypad with a timer.
    1. Correct passcode: Shake the phone until the buttons turn red and enter the code 8521 then hit the set button.
    2. The phone must be shaken and the code must be entered before the timer runs out.
8. Right Face: Shows an On/Off button in the top left and a black screen.
    1. Correct passcode: Click the button to turn the flashlight on. Tilt the phone upwards or downwards to move the light. Clip the Yellow and Red segments of the blue wire and hit the set button.
9. Back Face: Shows 6 wires with resistors on it and a compass. Spin the phone to move the compass heading. Clicking on a resistor selects it and clicking on it again locks in the heading value. Each resistor also deviates the compass heading to mimic changes in magnetic fields! Only the first one points to True North.
    1. Correct passcode: Click on the first resistor and spin the heading to 68 degrees, click it again. Click on the fifth resistor and spin the heading to 256 degrees, click it again. Click on the sixth resistor and spin the heading to 145 degrees, click it again. Finally, click the set button.
10. Left Face: Shows a 7x7 maze grid with a ball in the center. The phone can be tilted to move the ball and it must be placed in the correct cell.
    1.  Correct passcode is: Row 5 and Cell 4.
11. Top Face: Shows a camera with a capture button. Make sure you give camera permissions or it will not work. The camera is used to capture different hand poses.
    1. Correct passcode: Hold your hand in the center of the screen with all 5 fingers raised and click the capture button. Once the button goes from capturing… to capture, click the set button.
12. Bottom Face: Shows three batteries that need to be charged. To charge a battery, click on the battery and it will outline blue, get a flashlight and point it at the light sensor. The higher the brightness the more the battery charges. Once the level is correct, click it again.
    1. Correct passcode: Charge the first battery to 1 level, the second to 3 levels, and the third to 5 levels. Then hit the set button.
